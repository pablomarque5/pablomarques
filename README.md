# open-event
A open-source tool for events.

based on noisy-cricket framework http://github.com/quagliato/noisy-cricket

** DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS **

## Description
This tool is based on a old subscription system for students' event created by
me in 2012. I'm now migrating the old system to this tool, basing it on my
noisy-cricket framework and adding some features.

## Done
- User subscription;
- E-mail notifications;
- Dynamic-management "Editais" (aka "Chamada de trabalhos", aka "Call for works");

## Backlog
- Subscription and package management *(already created, pending import)*;
- Payment management *(already created, pending import)*;
- Custom questions on user subscriptions;
- Multilanguage *(pending noisy-cricket development)*;
